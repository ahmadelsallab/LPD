    "\n",
    "In this project we demonstrate how to use OpenCV only, with traditional computer vision approaches, to perform License Plate Detection (LPD). \n",
    "\n",
    "We follow two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- __Morphology based approach__: where only morphological transforms are used, along with some rules to detect the LP.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- __Charater based approach__: in addition to basic morphological approaches, basic char detection, also based on morphology, is used as an extra characteristic of the LP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the problem of Licence Plate Recognition (LPR), by recognizing the number and digits written, can be addressed by the second approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both approaches, we load HD videos (1080p). Due to the camera position, this is the most effective resolution to detect LP patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both approaches we merge car detection, using background subtraction, to narrow the search space."
